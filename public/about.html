  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am just an old lady trying to make it into this world.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time in the whimsical town of Quirkville, there lived a spry old lady named Gertrude McTicklepants. At
    the ripe age of 92, Gertrude had more energy than a caffeinated squirrel on a pogo stick.</p>

  <p>Every morning, she would don her neon pink jumpsuit with matching feather boa and rollerblade her way to the local
    bingo hall, leaving a trail of glitter and giggles in her wake. The other bingo players would stare in amazement as
    Gertrude gracefully skated around the tables, calling out numbers with the enthusiasm of a cheerleader at a pom-pom
    convention.</p>

  <p>Her secret to longevity? Gertrude avoided other people like the plague.</p>
  <p>So do me a favour and let me be like Gertrude.</p>
  <p>Go buy your own glitter
